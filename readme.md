# Code Refactor

This project is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accesssible.

## What I have did in this task:

1. make sure the HTML elements are in semantic order. 
2. I went through the structure of HTML elements and make sure all the elements follow a logical structure.
3. I added alt attributes for the image elements.
4. I put the heading attributes in sequential order.
5. I put descriptive comments before the section of the html.
6. I ensured all links are functioning correctly.
7. I cleaned up the CSS to make it more efficient by combining some elements to one class.

## What I learned from this project:

I learned to organise the HTML in a more logical order and make sure the CSS is more efficient. The descriptions before each elements are also very good to make the HTML more organised. In this way, the website will be more easy to maintain.
